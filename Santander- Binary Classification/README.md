by Sheena Cook

### Executive Summary

Data Science is solving a number of problems in the Finance Sector. Some of those problems include but are not limited to managing customer data, predictive analytics, fraud detection, and consumer analytics. Customer Analytics is related to customer acquisition, customer profitability, and segmentation. Machine Learning models can be deployed to gain insights around Customer Analytics. Currently Santander Bank has hosted a Kaggle competition tasking Data Scientists to build a model that can identify a customer who will make a specific transaction in the future. I will use several binary classification models to determine whether I can predict whether a customer will make a prediction or not. AUC will be the key metric to determine how well the model can classify if a customer will make a transaction or not.

### EDA 
EDA consisted of checking the data types of the features, checking null values, determining any correlations, and feature importance. My findings are below:

- dataset consisted of a train and test csv, both files contained 200k rows, with 200 features 
- no correlation between features 
- no null values 
- could not highlight any important features
- class imbalanced with target variable, minority class totaling .10 while majority class totaled .89, as a result applied SMOTE
- attempted PCA for dimensionality reduction but could not determine any feature elimination or feature importance

### Models


#### Supervised Models: Predicting a Customer Transaction w/ SMOTE 

|Model|Train Score|Test Score|AUC Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Logistic Regression| .799 | .790 | .86 |
|Random Forest| .1 | .893 |.70 |
|Naive Bayes| .864 | .870 |.60 | 


#### Unsupervised Models: Predicting a Customer Transaction w/ SMOTE

|Model|Train Score|Test Score|AUC Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Neural Net - dropout| .888 | .855 | .95 |
|Neural Net - early stop| .825 | .797 | .80 |

### Conclusion

#### Results

Logistic Regression - outperformed the attempted supervised models with a .86 AUC Score. Naive Bayes AUC score performed
poorly compared to the other supervised models because NB assumes that points close to the centroid of class are likely to be members of that class, which leads it to mislabel positive training points with features. This explains why it underperformed compared to Logistic regression, as Logistic Regression is only concerned with correctly classifying points so the signal from outliers is more influential. Logistic Regression is also known to outperform NB on larger datasets. For supervised models, Logistic Regression performed the best. 

Neural Network - to combat overfitting I used regularized techniques to fit a NN. The Dropout Neural Network returned the highest AUC score. Tuning additional hyperparameters to increase AUC score. For unsupervised models, the dropout method returned the best AUC score of .95. 

The Kaggle submission results from my models returned an AUC score between .50 to .60. These low scores indicate the models created overfit and not able to generalize to Santander's holdout set. Future work will include continual refining of models by tuning hyperparameters and attempting to undersample may return a better AUC score.

### Take away and Next steps 

#### To improve analysis:
- Attempt additional supervised and unsupervised models. 
- Additional tuning of hyperparameters to current models to optimize AUC score.
- Undersample data to decrease run time.
- Collecting additional data for customer segmentation since weâ€™ve determined customers who will make a future transaction.
